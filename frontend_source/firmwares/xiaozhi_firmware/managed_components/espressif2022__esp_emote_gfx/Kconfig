        help
            Enable support for FreeType fonts (TTF/OTF).
            This requires the FreeType library to be enabled.

            When enabled, you can use TrueType and OpenType fonts.
            When disabled, only LVGL C format fonts are supported.

        help
            Enable support for JPEG decoding in EAF (Emote Animation Format).
            This requires the ESP JPEG decoder component to be enabled.

            When enabled, EAF files can use JPEG encoding for image blocks.
            When disabled, JPEG encoding will not be available, reducing code size.

        help
            Enable support for Heatshrink decoding in EAF (Emote Animation Format).

            Note: Only supports 8-bit window and 4-bit lookahead if dynamic allocation is disabled.
